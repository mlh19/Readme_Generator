Professional Readme Generator

This application allows users to generate a Readme markdown file.

Uses must have Visual Studio (VS) and inquirer installed.

This application generates a Readme by asking a series of questions in the VS integradted terminal. Once all the questions have been answered, the Readme is generated in the current working directory on the left-hand side of the screen.
